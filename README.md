Mapping and tagging elements of a legal complaint

This is an [ATX Hack for Change 2018](https://atxh4c2018.devpost.com/) project to create a visual vocabulary for communicating about the status of a lawsuit by tagging elements of the complaint, such as the allegations and the elements of each claim.

The sample data relates to the [Democratic National Committee v. Russia complaint](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/6368549/democratic-national-committee-v-the-russian-federation/) filed in the Southern District of New York on April 20. Hopefully that'll be an interesting case to civic technologists, touching on issues like election law and the scope of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.
